She feigns attraction and tricks him, in a really crazy turn of events, down an alleyway. A strange source of inspiration, but I became hooked on the idea of this nasty guy following after this woman not knowing his own fate»</p>

			<p class="main text">«Me and Beni [Giles, co-writer] were writing it together and coming up with the hook using computer-based software, and throughout the session we were talking about how there's always this 'new' thing you need as a producer. When it comes to software and technology, it moves so fast and certain technology that you've just acquired becomes obsolete so quickly. There's this constant change, and that's where the chorus came from -— 'Need it but don't want it.' It's about the necessity of having to have this thing to continue, even if you don't particularly want it.»</p>
